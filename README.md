# Object-Localization-and-Classification

## <div>Introduction</div>
<div>
    This project aims to develop a system for object localization and classification using the Inception-v3 model. The system is designed to identify and locate objects within images, which can be utilized in various applications such as image search engines, automated surveillance, and robotics.
